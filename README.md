### What are we working on?

You can check out all our WIP and backlog items in the Issues tab. Basically, every issue is a design initiative that tackles one problem and achieves one objective. If you like Kanban better, go to Project tab and open the Design Board.

### How do I pick a job?

**Unassigned** items are free for a grab: if you see that no one is currently assigned to a feature, feel free to assign it to yourself or ask someone to assign it to you.
