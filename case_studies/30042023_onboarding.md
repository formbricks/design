### Problem statement
Formbricks does not collect insights on the user's objectives and segments, which prevents us from presenting the users with relevant features, tools, and templates. As a result, we manage to activate less than 50% of newly acquired users. 

How might we increase the adoption of Formbricks by personalising the user's experience with the platform and helping new users discover and use relevant products?

## 🚧 Delivery

## Next steps & impact

- Measure how many people complete the questionnaire;
- Survey the users: is the new onboarding helpful, how can we improve the onboarding experience further.
