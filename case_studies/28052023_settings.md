## Overview
Redesigning the survey configuration experience to increase the number of surveys created by enhancing customer experience.

### Problem statement
Today, the survey configuration is placed under the "Audience" tab. It is far from being intuitive, and the user stumbles upon many challenges. This inevitably impacts the number of surveys being launched successfully, as well as the user experience:
- 21% dropoff from the Template page;
- 63% dropoff from the Survey Audience page.

### Hypothesis
> Improving the experience of adding and configuing the survey will help increase the number of surveys created on the platform.

<img width="100%" alt="Hey Johannes, the 'Create Survey' CTA doesn't pop out to me bc it matches the rest of your coloring. For example, when I went to create a custom survey to see if you had implemented the old customizable surveys a la snoopForms, I got confused when the 'What's Poppin' screen came up in the lower right hand corner. I thought, 'oh, they don't have custom surveys available yet, they must want feedback on what people are expecting when they click that button'. Some way to highlight that the 'Create Survey' is the next step I think would make it clearer/easier for folks to move through the process. A contrasting color so it's a more obvious button would be my first thought. " src="https://github.com/formbricks/design/assets/22578094/ca6630e6-650e-4582-bebb-7870023b248f">

### Success metrics
- Enhanced customer exprience;
- Increased number of surveys created on the platform.

## Process
### Identifying the areas for improvement

![Formbricks Survey Creation Areas For Improvements](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22578094/236610758-1e4d3f9a-ba63-45af-8faf-bd7c7da2aa46.png)

1. New survey creation: from [the past studies](https://github.com/formbricks/design/blob/main/insights/23042023_users_survey.md#observations-from-the-past-studies), we know that users struggle to locate the "Create survey" button;
2. Audience tab: [past studies](https://github.com/formbricks/design/blob/main/insights/23042023_users_survey.md#observations-from-the-past-studies) and [UX Audit](https://github.com/formbricks/design/blob/main/insights/20042023_ux_audit.md) confirm it to be confusing and not intuitive;
3. The audience tab content can be further improved as well.

We have reviewed some products among Formbricks' competitors and made some rather interesting observations:
- Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Typeform (1, 2, 4) feature (one way or the other) a grid of templates, and open a template preview is a new page;
- Refiner's (3) demo page has a rich demo page with a dropdown, allowing to quickly switch between templates;
- Sprig's (5) template tiles show a preview of a template and opens a new modal with the template:

Formbricks is somewhat closer to Refiner in that regard, but allows switching between templates in the left panel. We could retain the existing behaviour (the interaction happening primarily in the left panel) by splitting the page view:

### Solution
## Survey Templates
To avoid confusing the user, we put a preview in a "browser window" to highlight and contextualise the survey preview.

## Survey Settings
In the survey settings, we implement two fundamental changes:
- Select "Standalone" survey by default;
- Add a warning to the Web App survey with a link to configuring the widget.

## Next steps & impact
- Monitor dropoff rate; 
- Explore implementing onboarding enhancements to improve widget adoption.
