🔴 — severe (having a critical impact on the customer experience, immediate action required)
🟠 — important (having a serious impact on the customer experience)
🟡 — improvement (an area for improvement or a minor fix)

## Executive summary
Overall, Formbricks is a solid, albeit basic, product that offers a seemingly smooth customer experience, hindered by overall lack of consistency, poor standards of user experience, interface design, writing, and lack of critical features that severely impact the product's usability.

- UX needs to be significantly improved across the entire user journey: from signing up to analysing survey results;
- A solid design system will help establish the ground rules and avoid inconsistencies;
- A set of firm and solid UX Writing guidelines is required to not only fix the existing writing flaws, but make Formbricks scalable;
- Severe usability violations need to be turned into items immediately and fixed as soon as possible.

## User Experience

- [ ] 1. Survey names are not forced to be unique. As a result, customers may end up having multiple instances of surveys with same types and names. 🔴
- [ ] 2. Link to the Home Page is missing, giving a false sense of entrapment. 🟡
- [ ] 3. Conflicting CTA placement (preview CTA & Create Survey) is confusing. Consider changing the preview design to avoid the confusion. 🟠
- [ ] 4. Back button is missing in the Survey Creation screen, the Preview, and the actual survey. Users cannot return to the previous screen or submit another answer to the question. 🔴
- [ ] 5. "Publish Survey" button is disabled until the widget is installed, but the user is given no explanation. 🟠
- [ ] 6. Optional and required fields are not marked in the survey. The progress bar is barely visible. As a result, users end up dropping the survey or providing poorly written answers to critical questions and focusing on optional questions, as seen in the recent user survey. 🔴
- [ ] 7. Pausing or stopping the survey requires going into the editing flow, not possible from the survey summary page. 🟡
- [ ] 8. Error states are missing from the style library. As a result, the errors are not communicated to the end user properly. 🔴
- [ ] 9. Customer avatars are generic, adding visual noise to the summary page. 🟡
- [ ] 10. Survey responses cannot be collapsed, deleted, or sorted. As a result, copying, extracting, or otherwise manipulating with the results of the survey is barely possible. 🟠

## Writing

- [ ] 1. “Not yet implemented” — the message does not communicate that the widget must be installed by the user. This might create the false sense of the product not being ready yet. 🟠
- [ ] 2. "Survey drafted" needs to be rewritten. Survey default name can be improved as well. 🟠
- [ ] 3. “Multiple choice single select”. The name can be improved: "multiple choice" alone would suffice. 🟡
- [ ] 4. "Choices" —> options. 🟡
- [ ] 5. "Who to ask", "When to ask", etc. The entire "Audience" page can be significantly rewritten, including the page name itself. 🟠
- [ ] 6. "Response options". 🟡
- [ ] 7. "Recontact options". 🟡
- [ ] 8. "Not implemented yet". 🟠
- [ ] 9. "You're editing a published survey" — the message can be improved. 🟡
- [ ] 10. "Shareable link" vs "Link survey" — naming consistency. 🟠

## UI Improvements
Largely, establishing a design system should help fix these. However, some UI improvements can be implemented across the platform right away.
- [ ] Icons consistency. 🟡
- [ ] Double border in the "Custom survey" button. 🟡
- [ ] Typography and text colour (i.e. input and button text placeholder colours are highly inconsistent). 🟠
- [ ] Customer avatars are inconsistent across the "Settings" pages. 🟠
